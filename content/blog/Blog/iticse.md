I just got home from the _Innovation and Technology in Computer Science_
(ITiCSE) conference in lovely Aberdeen, Scotland. I was there to present a small
experience paper on developing and using [RepoBee](https://repobee.org), an open
source tool for generating and managing large amounts of Git repositories for
students in higher education. The paper is available over in the [ACM Digital
Library](https://doi.org/10.1145/3304221.3319784), and it's my very first
publication outside of school, so I'm quite proud of it!

The conference itself was also terrific. The atmosphere was very friendly, there
were many interesting talks and social activities, and I have a hard time
imagining how a conference could be more inviting to a first-time
conference-goer like me. If you have a chance to attend it, I highly recommend
doing so.
