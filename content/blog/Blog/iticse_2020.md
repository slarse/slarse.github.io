In 2019, [I presented RepoBee at the ITiCSE conference]({filename}iticse.md)
in Aberdeen. This year, ITiCSE went virtual, but RepoBee still made an
appearance in the new tools and tricks section with a small, two-page paper.
Although I let my co-author Ric Glassey deal with the virtual presentation, I'm
still quite proud that I had another paper on RepoBee published at one of the
major tech education conferences.

If you're unaware, [RepoBee](https://repobee.org) is a tool for managing Git
repositories in an educational context. A basic use case is for a teacher to
have a template repository, and create copies of it for students or groups of
students on GitHub or GitLab. If you've heard of [GitHub
Classroom](https://classroom.github.com), it's the same concept, but RepoBee is
far more powerful and customizable, at the expense of being a little more
intricate to use.

In the paper, Ric and I mostly discuss the need for customizable tools to tailor
to different teaching methodologies and preferences, and how RepoBee makes this
possible through plugins and by supporting both GitHub and GitLab. We also
discuss the two primary modes of RepoBee, and how they can be combined. In
_dictate_ mode, RepoBee creates repositories for students based on template
repositories.  In _discovery_ mode, RepoBee only sets up student teams/groups,
and then the students themselves are responsible for creating the repositories,
which RepoBee can then "discover".

The full paper [is available in the ACM digital
library](https://doi.org/10.1145/3341525.3393999).
