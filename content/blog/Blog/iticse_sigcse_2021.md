Another year, and a few new papers published on my favorite project:
[RepoBee](https://repobee.org). We made a hat-trick and appeared at
ITiCSE 2021 for a third year in a row (see [ITiCSE 2019]({filename}iticse.md)
and [ITiCSE 2020]({filename}iticse_2020.md)), but this time we managed to sneak
in two papers. One paper that I presented detailed [RepoBee's double-blind peer
review](https://doi.org/10.1145/3456565.3460031), and the other paper that was
presented by my colleague Tobias showcased the [repobee-sanitizer
plugin](https://doi.org/10.1145/3456565.3460036). Amazingly, the presentations
won [both "Best Presentation" awards for their
category](https://iticse.acm.org/best-paper-award/).

We also made an appearance at SIGCSE with a 20-minute demo and Q&A. The teaser
trailer for the demo [is available
here](https://repobee.org/media/repobee-demo.mp4). The demo itself was
essentially that, but less compressed and a little more elaborate.
It was followed by a nicely active Q&A, where we made some new connections.

All my publications can be found on the [Publications
page]({filename}/pages/essays.md).
