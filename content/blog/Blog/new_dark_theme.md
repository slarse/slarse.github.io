If you've _ever_ visited my blog before, you'll notice it looks a bit
different. I finally took the time to make a dark theme! Only 5 or so years late
to the party. But late or not, I have a new theme to show off, so let's have a
look!

# Before and after
I only put a couple of hours into trying out different colors and contrasts, so
this is still a bit of a work in progress. But I can't say I'm not pleased.
Let's have a look at what it used to look like.

<img alt="The site with the old light theme" src="./images/new_dark_theme/before.png" style="max-width: 95%;">

So, that doesn't look terrible in any way, but it doesn't fit the "programmer
aesthetic". It doesn't fit _my_ aesthetic. The new theme is much more "me", and
although you should already be seeing it all around here, here's the same image
as above with the new theme.

Much better! There are still a few rough edges, and I keep finding details where
the old theme isn't being overridden correctly (because this is all just _on top
of_ Bootstrap), but it's all mostly there.

# Parts of the puzzle
There are really only two parts to this. I'm still using the same
[`voidy-bootstrap` theme](https://github.com/robulouski/voidy-bootstrap) as
before, but I rewrote some of the CSS with the somewhat Halloween-looking
experience you're looking at right now. Which is fitting, considering Halloween
is just around the corner!

The second part is the fantastic
[`dracula` theme for Pygments](https://draculatheme.com/pygments)
which gives the neat colorization of code snippets. That I find to be the single
largest improvement.

# Enjoy!
That's all there is to it, enjoy the new theme!
