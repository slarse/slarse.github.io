Title: Introducing my Wiki!

A while ago, I decided that I wanted to have a low-effort way of recording what
I learn out in the open. When I publish a blog post I feel compelled to keep
the standard of the writing on a fairly high level. I've started dozens of
articles that I never published because I couldn't massage them into a state
that meeting my own standards. And that's not even counting the hundreds
of articles that I never even started because it seemed like too much of an
effort to record a tiny learning experience.

This strongly goes against the _Record What You Learn_ an _Share What You
Learn_ patterns from [Apprenticeship
Patterns]({filename}/blog/Reviews/apprenticeship_patterns.md); two patterns
that I value highly. Enter the Wiki!

# My public Wiki
The [Wiki]({filename}/pages/wiki/index.md) can be reached from the menu bar at the
top of the page. Here, I jot down quick notes about what I learn, what I have
yet to learn and anything else that I feel is worth recording. The quality of
the writing will range from poor to worse, and it'll be haphazardly organized,
at least initially. I hope to turn this into a wealth of knowledge both for
myself and for others in the coming years.

## Why not use an established Wiki software?
Although there are several open source Wikis out there, such as
[XWiki](https://xwiki.org), they're usually quite heavy and require a backend.
This site is a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page),
which is very cheap to host and requires no particular security considerations
due to the lack of a backend. I quite like those properties, and I'm currently
adapting the templates for this site to better suit my Wiki ambitions. This
first rendition is _rough_, but it suits my current needs, and improving upon
it as my Wiki grows wll be an interesting challenge.

## Searching the Wiki
The [Wiki]({filename}/pages/wiki/index.md) is indexed along with the rest of the site
and can be searched using the [search bar]({filename}/blog/Blog/search.md) on
the [home page]({index}). In other words, you can search for anything on
this website through that single search bar!

## Going forward
I intend to keep improving the wiki. As the amount of content grows, I expect to
have to improve the layout, cross-document linking and other related features.
I'm very excited to finally get around to this as I've been thinking about it
for a long time. Even though I do hope others will find it useful, it's mostly
for my own gain, and I'm confident it will serve me well.
