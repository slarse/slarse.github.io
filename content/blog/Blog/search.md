I've been meaning to take this blog into more of the Wiki direction. Or rather
some unholy mixture of a Wiki and a blog. An important step in that direction is
full text search, which I've now got!

This blog is powered by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), and quite
recently a new plugin called
[pelican-search](https://github.com/pelican-plugins/search) popped up.
It's quite simple: it adds the search bar you see on the [home
page]({index}), which taps into the powerful [Stork](https://stork-search.net/)
search library.

It all sums up to the super fast search bar that all visitors of this website
now have at their disposal. Pretty neat!
