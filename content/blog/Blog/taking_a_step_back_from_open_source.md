Over the past couple of years, I've half-heartedly tried to keep up with the
bar I set for open source contributions back when I was in university. It has
not been easy, and ultimately I haven't been able to align my current projects
with where I'm taking my career. I's time for me to take a step back.

# Open source development got me to where I am
From creating [RepoBee](https://repobee.org) to maintaining
[Spoon](https://github.com/inria/spoon), I've spent thousands upon
thousands of hours of my free time contributing to projects and putting them out
there for the world to see and use. It served me well in developing my skills,
but also in more unexpected ways such as opening doors to [publishing articles
at academic conferences]({filename}/pages/essays.md) and
mentoring more junior developers well before I had a full time
job[ref]Sadly, I never managed to find someone to mentor _me_.[/ref]. I am fully
convinced that I would not be nearly as skilled a software engineer as I am
today had I not had these experiences. Given the choice, I would take the exact
same path all over again.

# But things have changed
I loved open source development as a university student because it gave me the
opportunity to collaborate with other developers on _real_ and _long-term_
projects, honing skills that were not being honed in the predominantly
theoretical computer science program I attended[ref]I still think that studying
computer science was well worth my time, but that's a topic for another blog
post.[/ref]. I needed to ground the theoretical learnings in practical
application, and open source development gave me an outlet where I could do just
that.

However, I must now recognize that those circumstances are in the past, and new
circumstances surround my day-to-day. A lot of what I got out of open source
development as a student, such as collaboration and real-world application, I'm
now getting from my job. This greatly lessens the appeal of open source
development for me, as it was never about some altruistic notion of helping
others, but about what I could learn from the experience. It was all part of my
skills development process.

What I _now_ desire from my skills development in my free time is to explore new
technologies and concepts that I don't have time or reason to work with on the
job. This leads to a lot of [doing a little bit of
this]({filename}/blog/Programming/highlight_with_tree_sitter.md) and [a little
bit of that](content/blog/Programming/postgresql/basic_indexing.md). While this
may still translate to the odd [open source repository with some half-finished
project](https://github.com/slarse/rut), it does not mesh well with long-term
maintenance of established projects.

# So what's up now?
This disconnect between my own needs and open source development has been
weighing on me for years. I've felt guilty for neglecting the projects I
maintain, but at the same time haven't been able to do anything about it.
A little while back, I decided that it wasn't a healthy way to go about it, and
decided to more officially scale down my open source involvement. I started out
by [resigning as a maintainer of Spoon](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/pull/5863),
and am finishing up with this blog post as a statement of my intentions.

I will still attempt to respond to issues and PRs on my existing open source
projects. I will attempt to fix critical bugs in any project I maintain. But the
keyword is _attempt_. I make no promises about anything, responses from me will
likely be few and far between. Complex issues may never be investigated, and
major PRs with difficult to integrate code will likely not be integrated.

Things may change in the future. I may find that spark for open source
development again and dive back into it. But now is not that time. Right now, I
just want time for myself to tinker with things that interest me, but are of
little use to others in the state that I leave them.
