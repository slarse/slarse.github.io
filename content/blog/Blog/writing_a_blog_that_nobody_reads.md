Title: Why I write a blog that nobody reads (and you should, too)

I don't write this blog in hopes that it will get a lot of traction. I don't
market it, I don't try to optimize it for SEO and I I don't even tell my
friends and coworkers about it. Although I would of course be delighted to hear
someone who found something useful in my blog, I really write it for myself.
And what could I possibly get out of that? Glad you asked.

## Expressing thoughts and ideas is hard
I'm a software engineer. My job is mostly about coming up with neat solutions to
tricky problems. Coming up with the solution in my head is however just part of
the fight as I also need to be able to concisely express the ideas to my
colleagues. Even harder is to convey the heart of a technical problem or
solution to a non-technical person, which happens more often than you might
think. For example, a manager might come around and inquire about why something
still isn't working as it should or why project X got so expensive.

Writing a technical blog about helps me practice this skill. I put quite a bit
of care into most blog posts I write and I also often look back at earlier posts
to consider how I can improve the writing.

## Retaining knowledge is also hard
Another reason for why I write this blog is to retain knowledge. Writing about
something you've just learned is a great way to further cement that knowledge.
As I put a large amount of care into my posts and want to be sure that I get
things right, I also often pick up bits and pieces that I missed when attaining
the knowledge I'm writing about.

As I noted in [the post about my new
Wiki]({filename}/blog/Blog/publishing_wiki.md), my strive toward high quality
posts does unfortunately mean that I don't publish blog posts all that often.
That's where the [Wiki]({filename}/pages/wiki/index.md) comes in. In there I
simply write things down without any particular care about quality. I can
thereby help myself retain knowledge about things that I don't yet understand
well enough to write a blog post about, or that I simply don't have the time
to write about.

## Putting yourself out there is perhaps even harder
Exposing your work to the public is not something most people are comfortable
with. It's easy to feel self-conscious about the things you create and be afraid
of potential backlash or negative feedback. Putting up blog posts strengthens my
confidence when it comes to communicating and expressing myself, even if I don't
typically get any direct feedback (be that positive or negative) due to not
having comments on this site. Similarly, putting up [my projects on
GitHub](https://github.com/slarse) strengthens my confidence in my technical
skills.

Having published my work for many years I now feel little to no anxiety about
publishing my work. Rather, I find it enjoyable to put something out in the open
where others may find it, even if few ever do.
