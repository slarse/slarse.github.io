Whenever I find myself occupied with some monotonous task, I
very much enjoy listening to podcasts. As programming is my
number one passion, and Python is my favorite language, I tend
to listen to podcasts that relate to them. In this post, I'll
give a brief overview of my three favorite podcasts, and just
why I enjoy them as much as I do!

### Python Bytes
[_Python Bytes_](https://pythonbytes.fm/) was the first podcast I ever
listened to. It's a really neat show that comes out on a weekly basis,
and focuses on delivering news and headlines in the Python community.
The best part about the show is that they highlight awesome Python
packages and tools that I would not have heard about otherwise. The
episodes are fairly short, usually around the 20 minute mark, so they
fit in even on a short commute. The episodes have, as far as I can recall,
been published every week without fail for almost two years now, which
is really nice. The hosts (Brian Okken and Micheal Kennedy) have great
chemistry, and the show is recorded with decent enough equipment and
well edited. All in all, I really enjoy the show and highly recommend it!

### Talk Python To Me
[_Talk Python To Me_](https://talkpython.fm/) is Micheal Kennedy's (from
Python Bytes) own show. In each episode, Micheal invites someone (sometimes
multiple people at once) from
the Python community to come talk about what they do. The episodes
are fairly lengthy and often reach for the 1 hour mark, but they are
also mostly entertaining throughout. As with Python Bytes, the episodes
are well edited, meaning that awkward pauses and the like shine with their
absence. Talk Python To Me is probably my favorite podcast right now and
I can't recommend it enough.

### Podcast.\_\_init\_\_
[_Podcast.\_\_init\_\_\_](https://www.podcastinit.com/) is very similar to
Talk Python To Me, seeing as both shows revolve around inviting prominent
personalities to talk about their work. I haven't listened to all that many
of the episodes, but I really enjoyed the first 7-8 episodes. Initially,
the show had two hosts, but in the later episodes one of the original hosts
is conspicuously abscent, which to me was to the detriment of the show. It's
still a good show, mind you, but I enjoyed the early episodes more than the
few late ones that I've listened to. The length of the episodes seem hover
around the 1 hour mark, +/- some 20 minutes. I will probably revisit this
post once I've listened to a few more of the episodes, but as it stands I
recommend listening to the show from the beginning.

### Did I miss something?
Those were my 3 top picks for Python podcasts. If you feel like I've missed
