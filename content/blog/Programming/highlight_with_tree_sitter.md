As of my previous post on [extending NeoVim for commenting and uncommenting
code blocks]({filename}comment_out_code_neovim.md), I'm on something of a
NeoVim extension streak. The flavor of the week is syntax highlighting. I've been
using the highly customizable
[nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) for the
past few years. This depends on there being a
[Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) parser for whatever
language you're working with. Usually there is, but sometimes you run into
languages that are esoteric enough that there aren't any parsers available. And
then you're SOL on the whole syntax highlighting part. Unless, of course, you
write a parser of your own. Which naturally is what we'll do.

This is the first article in a series on working with Tree-sitter to syntax
highlight anything. Although this article series is intended for a
NeoVim-inclined audience, this first part has nothing to do with NeoVim and can
be enjoyed by anyone interested in Tree-sitter or parsers in general. In the
still under construction second part, we'll dive into working with and utilizing
Tree-sitter in NeoVim.

# What's this Tree-sitter thing?
[Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) is a parser generator
tool for the modern era. What's a parser generator, you ask? Well, it's exactly
what it sounds like: a tool to generate a parser! By defining the syntax of a
language in a way the parser generator understands, it can generate a parser
for you that can take source code of that language and transform it into a
syntax tree.

Parser generators aren't a new concept. [GNU
Bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bison) has been around for 38 years at
this point, and [YACC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc) had been around for a
decade by the time Bison arrived. So, not at all a new concept. What's novel
with Tree-sitter is both how easy it is to define a grammar as long as you know
a little bit of JavaScript and the fact that [syntax highlighting is a built-in
feature](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/syntax-highlighting).

You can do a lot of cool things with Tree-sitter's syntax trees, but in this
article our focus is on syntax highlighting.

> This article assumes that you have access to a `bash`-like shell (such as
> `bash` or `zsh`). Commands intended to be executed in a shell are prefixed
> with `$`. Lines that follow a `$`-prefixed line but are not prefixed are
> output lines.

# Working example: Markdown Simple
As a driving example for this article series, we'll look at a tiny subset of
Markdown, which should be familiar to most anyone in the target audience.
Specifically, we want to be able to highlight the following containing
headings, paragraphs, inline code and code blocks.

````
# This is a heading
This little paragraph of text with `inline code`

```
const words = ["javascript", "code", "highlighting"];

for (const word of words) {
    console.log(word);
}
```

# This is another heading
Another paragraph with a # in the middle.
````

**Store these sample file contents in `test.mds` for later use**!

I call this subset _Markdown Simple_ and choose to write it in files with the
`.mds` file extension. At the end of this article, we'll have fully functioning
syntax highlighting for `.mds` files, including properly highlighted JavaScript
code in the multiline code blocks!

# Getting started with creating Tree-sitter parsers
Tree-sitter's docs have a good [Project
setup](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#project-setup)
section, but I found that it lacks a few key ingredients for our purposes. I
will offer an augmented version here.

As a pre-requisite, you must have decently up-to-date versions `node` and `npm`
installed. With that, we can get started creating a project directory.

```bash
$ mkdir tree-sitter-mds
$ cd tree-sitter-mds
$ npm init
```

The `npm init` command will prompt you for a bunch of stuff. If you don't know
what to choose, just go with the defaults, it hardly matters for the rest of
this article. Now, you need the `tree-sitter-cli` application, which you can
also get with `npm`.

```bash
$ npm --save-dev tree-sitter-cli
```

Then setup a configuration file for `tree-sitter-cli`.

```bash
$ npx tree-sitter init-config
```

Note where the configuration file is written to. You may need to edit it later
for your project to be located by Tree-sitter.

## Baby's first grammar rule
As previously mentioned, a parser generator reads a grammar that defines some
language and spits out a parser for it. In Tree-sitter, we define grammar rules
in JavaScript, in a file called `grammar.js` in the root of your project. It
should have the following structure.

```javascript
module.exports = grammar({
  name: 'markdownsimple',

  rules: {
      // grammar rules go in here
  }
});
```

If you now try to generate a parser you should get an error about there not being any rules.

```bash
$ npx tree-sitter generate
[stdin]:409
    throw new Error("Grammar must have at least one rule.");
```

Let's define a very simple grammar just to be able to parse the file.

```javascript
rules: {
    source_file: $ => $.text,

    text: _ => /(.|\n)+/,
}
```

Put the above rules into your `grammar.js` file and then generate and run the
parser.

```bash
$ npx tree-sitter generate
$ npx tree-sitter parse test.mds
```

This should produce a simple syntax tree.

```scheme
(source_file [0, 0] - [13, 0]
  (text [0, 0] - [13, 0]))
```

Let's dissect the grammar in detail so we can improve the syntax tree
granularity. The root node is the `source_file`. Every syntax tree is rooted in
this node, and there is only one of them for each parsed file. The rule
definition may look a bit strange at first sight.

```javascript
source_file: $ => $.text
```

Any non-trivial grammar is built by composing rules. Any rule that references
another rule is a so-called
[_non-terminal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_and_nonterminal_symbols).
The above rule says that the `source_file` consists of precisely one `text`
node. So `source_file` is a non-terminal that references `text`.

We then define the `text` rule using regex.

```javascript
_ => /(.+|\n)/,
```

This regex just captures any character (`.`) or line feeds (`\n`). As the rule
does not reference any other rules, it is a so-called
[_terminal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_and_nonterminal_symbols).

> Note: Tree-sitter supports [`LR(1)`
> grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser), which [limits the kinds of
> regex
> expressions](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#the-grammar-dsl)
> that can be used. The finer details of this is beyond the scope of this
> article.

In summary, our grammar currently defines a `source_file` as a single `text`
node. Of course, we could immediately define `source_file` as the regex that
currently resides in `text` at this point; I just wanted to illustrate the
concept of terminal and non-terminal rules as it will become important in the
next part.

## Let there be color
The goal of this article is to achieve nice syntax highlighting, so let's get
started immediately. We can highlight a file using the `highlight` command,
but it won't work out of the box.

If you run the below command, you should get an error message.

```bash
$ npx tree-sitter highlight test.mds
No language found for path `test.mds`

If a language should be associated with this file extension, please ensure the path to `test.mds` is inside one of the following directories as specified by your 'config.json':

  1. /home/slarse/github  
  2. /home/slarse/src  
  3. /home/slarse/source  
  4. /home/slarse/projects  
  5. /home/slarse/dev  
  6. /home/slarse/git

If the directory that contains the relevant grammar for `test.mds` is not listed above, please add the directory to the list of directories in your config file, located at /home/slarse/.config/tree-sitter/config.json
```

To resolve this we need to add some information to `package.json`. Put the
following in there.

> Tip: It's easy to break the `package.json` file with a misplaced comma. To
> ensure that you don't break the syntax of `package.json`, run `npm i` until it
> doesn't complain anymore.

```json
  "tree-sitter": [
    {
      "scope": "source.markdownsimple",
      "file-types": [
        "mds"
      ],
      "highlights": [
        "queries/highlights.scm"
      ]
    }
  ],
```

Now run the `highlight` command again. If you get the _same_ error as before,
you need to add the directory that contains you project's directory to
Tree-sitter's `config.json` file. For example, my project is located in
`/home/slarse/projects/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-mds`, so I add the path
`/home/slarse/projects/tree-sitter` to the list of paths at the top of
`/home/slarse/.config/tree-sitter/config.json`.

With that fixed, you should get a new error.

```bash
$ npx tree-sitter highlight test.mds
Failed to read query file "queries/highlights.scm"

Caused by:
    No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

This means your project was correctly located. We now need to define _queries_
for our highlight. Queries allow us to select nodes in the syntax tree and
assign pre-defined semantic meaning to them. Put the following content in the
file `queries/highlights.scm` in your project directory.

```scheme
(text) @string
```

> I won't go into detail on queries in this article. You can find all captures
> (e.g. `@string`) available [over
> here](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#highlights),
> and you can read more about queries as a whole [over
> here](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#pattern-matching-with-queries).

This says that any `text` node should be considered a `string`. Running the
highlight command again, you ought to get some colored output.

![Simple syntax higlighting]({photo}tree_sitter_highlighting/first_highlight.png)

Not all that impressive; as all nodes with any content are `text` nodes
everything is just highlighted as a string. In my Tree-sitter configuration
the `string` color happens happens to be a shade of green, but it may be
different for you. For more granular highlighting, we need a more granular
syntax tree to perform queries against.

# Refining the grammar
The basic pieces of the puzzle are now in place. We have a rudimentary syntax
tree allowing for an equally rudimentary syntax highlighting. It's now time to
start refining the grammar to capture different components. With some crude
annotations in `()`, we want a structure like this.

````
(section)
# This is a heading (heading)
This little paragraph of text with `inline code` (paragraph (text) (inlineCode (codeText)))

``` (codeBlock (codeText))
const words = ["javascript", "code", "highlighting"];

for (const word of words) {
    console.log(word);
}
```

# This is another heading (heading)
And this is another little paragraph. (paragraph (text))
````

Let's start off only with capturing the additional `section` and `heading` nodes
with new rules.

```javascript
rules: {
  source_file: $ => repeat($.section),

  section: $ => seq(
    $.heading,
    repeat($.text),
  ),

  heading: _ => /#.+/,

  text: _ => /(.|\n)+/,
}
```

Our non-terminals `source_file` and `section` bring in ways of composing rules
with the `repeat()` and `seq()` composers. `repeat(rule)` means "repeat rule
zero or more times, while `seq(rules...)` means "match these rules in this
order". So a `source_file` node is zero or more `section` nodes, and a `section`
node is a `heading` followed by zero or more `text` nodes.

Generating and running the parser again, this lands us with a slightly more
granular syntax tree where we separately capture the section's heading.

```scheme
(source_file [0, 0] - [13, 0]
  (section [0, 0] - [13, 0]
    (heading [0, 0] - [0, 19])
    (text [0, 19] - [13, 0])))
```

Clearly there's a bug here: we only have one section, yet our source file
contains two. The reason for this is that `text` is too liberal, it captures `#`
characters anywhere on the line. We must adjust the regex to disallow `#`
directly after line feeds.

```javascript
text: _ => /([^#]|[^\n]#)+/,
```

Here we say that `text` is either not a `#`, or it's a non-linefeed character
followed by `#`. Generating and parsing again we should now have our basic
section structure mapped out.

```scheme
(source_file [0, 0] - [13, 0]
  (section [0, 0] - [11, 0]
    (heading [0, 0] - [0, 19])
    (text [0, 19] - [11, 0]))
  (section [11, 0] - [13, 0]
    (heading [11, 0] - [11, 25])
    (text [11, 25] - [13, 0])))
```

Great! We can now also adjust the query in `queries/highlights.scm` to only
highlight headings.

```scheme
(heading) @string
```

This should land you with the following highlighting.

![Syntax highlighting only on headings]({photo}tree_sitter_highlighting/second_highlight.png)

Nice!

# Capturing inline code and code blocks
The only thing left for us to capture is inline code and code blocks. This is
however where it starts to get a little bit complicated, so let's take each of
these in turn.

## Capturing code blocks
Code blocks are relatively simple to capture in isolation. A rule for code
blocks could look as follows.

```javascript
codeBlock: $ => seq(
  '```',
  $.codeText,
  '```',
),

codeText: _ => /[^`]*/,
```

We could inline `codeText` into the `codeBlock`, but making it a separate rule
will make it easier for us to highlight the content of the code block without
affecting the backticks around it. Note that `codeText` is not quite the same as
`text`; the former allows any _zero or more_ characters except for backticks.
This will of course make it impossible to use backticks inside of a `codeBlock`,
which is a simplification we're going with here. Extending the rule to allow
for backticks within a `codeBlock` node is left as an exercise to the reader.

We can now extend our `section` rule to contain `codeBlock`s.

```javascript
section: $ => seq(
  $.heading,
  repeat(
    choice(
      $.text,
      $.codeBlock,
    )
  ),
),
```

If you put this in and run it, you may be a bit surprised to see that the output
doesn't change from before. The syntax tree still consists of two `section`s
containing one `heading` and `text` each. This is because `text` is consuming
the backticks that should delimit a `codeBlock`. We'll address this at the same
time as we define our paragraphs in the next part.

## Paragraphs with text and inline code
We want to define grammar rules such that the parser can recognize _paragraphs_
that are composed of one or more `text` and/or `inlineCode` nodes. The
`inlineCode` rule is quite simple: a backtick, followed by zero or more
characters that are anything but a backtick (i.e. `codeText`), followed by a
backtick.

```javascript
inlineCode: $ => seq(
  '`',
  $.codeText,
  '`',
),
```

We also need to alter the `text` terminal to not allow backticks, because
otherwise it will just consume them like it did the `#` before. This will also
allow our `codeBlock` rule to actually consume something.

```javascript
text: _ => /([^#`]|[^\n]#)+/,
```

Now we can define the `paragraph` non-terminal which, again, should be one or
more `inlineCode` or `text`.

```javascript
paragraph: $ => repeat1(
  choice(
    $.inlineCode,
    $.text,
  ),
),
```

And then we update the `section` to repeat `paragraph` instead of `text`.

```javascript
section: $ => seq(
  $.heading,
  repeat(
    choice(
      $.paragraph,
      $.codeBlock,
    )
  ),
),
```

We end up with the following rule set.

```javascript
rules: {
  source_file: $ => repeat($.section),

  section: $ => seq(
    $.heading,
    repeat(
      choice(
        $.paragraph,
        $.codeBlock,
      )
    ),
  ),

  paragraph: $ => repeat1(
    choice(
      $.inlineCode,
      $.text,
    ),
  ),

  inlineCode: $ => seq(
    '`',
    $.codeText,
    '`',
  ),

  codeBlock: $ => seq(
    '```',
    $.codeText,
    '```',
  ),

  codeText: _ => /[^`]*/,

  heading: _ => /#.+/,

  text: _ => /([^#`]|[^\n]#)+/,
}
```

If you try this out, you'll find that it doesn't work, Tree-sitter won't even
generate a parser for you. Instead, it complains about a conflict. Oh, dear.

## Resolving a conflict in the grammar
A conflict in the grammar occurs when there are multiple ways for Tree-sitter
to interpret the rules you've provided it with. In the case of our `paragraph`
rule, Tree-sitter has the following to say.

```bash
$ npx tree-sitter generate
Unresolved conflict for symbol sequence:

  heading  paragraph_repeat1  â¢  '`'  â¦

Possible interpretations:

  1:  heading  (paragraph  paragraph_repeat1)  â¢  '`'  â¦
  2:  heading  (paragraph_repeat1  paragraph_repeat1  â¢  paragraph_repeat1)

Possible resolutions:

  1:  Specify a left or right associativity in `paragraph`
  2:  Add a conflict for these rules: `paragraph`
```

This is a little bit hard to interpret if you haven't worked a lot with parsers
before. The short of it is that our use of the `paragraph` rule is ambiguous due
to the `paragraph` being repeated in the `section` rule, and then is itself a
repetition. For example, how should the first paragraph of the first section be
parsed, as shown below, be parsed?

```
This little paragraph of text with `inline code`
```

Is it one paragraph containing `text` and `inlineCode`, i.e. `(paragraph (text)
(inlineCode))`? Or is it perhaps two paragraphs, one with the `text` and one
with the `inlineCode`, i.e. `(paragraph (text))` and `(paragraph (inlineCode))`?
It's impossible to tell based on the rules we've defined.

To get rid of this ambiguity, we can use
[_associativity_](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#using-associativity).
As associativity is a bit of a brain twister the first time around, we won't
bother trying to fully understand it here. We'll just try both and see what
happens. We can make a rule left- or right-associative by wrapping it in
`prec.left()` or `prec.right()`, respectively. Doing that in turn, we get the
following two parse results for this part of the tree.

```scheme
; left-associative result
(paragraph (text))
(paragraph (inlineCode))

; right-associative result
(paragraph (text) (inlineCode))
```

The right-associative version looks like what we sketched out before embarking
down this road, so we'll adjust the rule accordingly.

```javascript
paragraph: $ => prec.right(repeat1(
  choice(
    $.inlineCode,
    $.text,
  ),
)),
```

And with that, we can now create a syntax tree with a sufficient level of
granularity to achieve the highlighting we set out to. If you generate the
parser again and run it, you should see a tree like this.

```scheme
(source_file [0, 0] - [13, 0]
  (section [0, 0] - [9, 3]
    (heading [0, 0] - [0, 19])
    (paragraph [0, 19] - [1, 48]
      (text [0, 19] - [1, 35])
      (inlineCode [1, 35] - [1, 48]
        (codeText [1, 36] - [1, 47])))
    (codeBlock [1, 48] - [9, 3]
      (codeText [3, 3] - [9, 0])))
  (section [9, 3] - [13, 0]
    (heading [9, 3] - [11, 25])
    (paragraph [11, 25] - [13, 0]
      (text [11, 25] - [13, 0]))))
```

We still only have a single highlight query, though, so next up is improving
that.

## Improving the highlight queries
We now have a significantly more granular syntax tree to work with. As a first
attempt, let's color inline code including backticks with one color, code block
backticks with one color and finally the code blocks themselves with another
color.

```scheme
(heading) @string
(inlineCode) @property
(codeBlock) @punctuation.delimiter
(codeBlock (codeText) @module)
```

Here we have our first non-trivial use of queries, as we have two queries
referencing the same type of node: `codeBlock`. The first query marks the
entire `codeBlock` with `@punctuation.delimiter`, which is dark grey in my color
scheme. Then we mark `codeText` _inside_ the `codeBlock` as a `@module`, which
is yellow in my color scheme. The latter query is more specific than the former,
and so takes precedence. The result is a significant improvement over our
starting point.

![Syntax highlighting on headings, inline code and code blocks]({photo}tree_sitter_highlighting/third_highlight.png)

But it's still not _great_. Having yellow JavaScript code is a marginal
improvement over just white code. This is where Tree-sitter's killer syntax
highlighting feature comes into play:
[injections](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/syntax-highlighting#language-injection)

## Injecting a JavaScript parser
Injections are super cool. They allow us to succinctly state that certain nodes
should be parsed with some other parser than the one we're currently using. Just
like with highlights, injections are specified with queries. What makes this
even cooler is that the author of some given parser doesn't need to have thought
about this; you can tack it on afterwards due to queries being completely
separate from the parser itself.

First of all, we need to extend our `package.json` with an `injections` key.

```json
  "tree-sitter": [
    {
      "scope": "source.markdownsimple",
      "file-types": [
        "mds"
      ],
      "highlights": [
        "queries/highlights.scm"
      ],
      "injections": [
        "queries/injections.scm"
      ]
    }
  ],
```

Then we add a file at `queries/injections.scm` with the following query.

```scheme
(((codeBlock (codeText) @injection.content))
  (#set! injection.language "javascript"))
```

Unfortunately, the highlight queries will interfere a bit with this injection,
so we also need to reduce our `queries/highlights.scm` file to the following.

```scheme
(heading) @string
(inlineCode) @property
```

But with that change, highlighting is now a lot more interesting. Although,
admittedly, the color scheme could definitely use some work.

![Syntax highlighting on headings, inline code and JavaScript injection in code blocks]({photo}tree_sitter_highlighting/final_highlight.png)

With that, we've achieved the highlighting goals we set out to at the beginning
of the article.

# Summary
In this article, we explored the basics of Tree-sitter and how to apply it to
provide syntax highlighting for a simple markup language. The full source code
for the project can be found
[in the companion repository](https://github.com/slarse/tree-sitter-mds).
There are still numerous shortcomings with this implementation, such as the fact
that `codeBlock`s cannot contain backticks, or that empty lines between
paragraphs don't actually produce multiple paragraphs in the syntax tree. But
the point of this article wasn't to produce a perfect Markdown Simple parser,
but rather illustrate some fundamental concepts of creating parsers with
Tree-sitter. And that, I think, has been achieved.

In the next part of this article series, we'll explore working with Tree-sitter
in NeoVim!

The final versions of the grammar and queries are inlined below for your
convenience.

```javascript
// grammar.js
module.exports = grammar({
  name: 'markdownsimple',

  rules: {
    source_file: $ => repeat($.section),

    section: $ => seq(
      $.heading,
      repeat(
        choice(
          $.paragraph,
          $.codeBlock,
        )
      ),
    ),

    paragraph: $ => prec.right(repeat1(
      choice(
        $.inlineCode,
        $.text,
      ),
    )),

    inlineCode: $ => seq(
      '`',
      $.codeText,
      '`',
    ),

    codeBlock: $ => seq(
      '```',
      $.codeText,
      '```',
    ),

    codeText: _ => /[^`]*/,

    heading: _ => /#.+/,

    text: _ => /([^#`]|[^\n]#)+/,
  }
});
```

```scheme
; queries/highlights.scm
(heading) @string
(inlineCode) @property
```

```scheme
; queries/injections.scm
(((codeBlock (codeText) @injection.content))
	(#set! injection.language "javascript"))
```
