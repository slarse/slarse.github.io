Welcome to the second part of the TornadoFX+Exposed series of articles. In this
part, we'll take a look at how to create a TornadoFX view for the `Categories`
table. In the next part, we'll expand upon the view and make it possible to
add, edit and delete rows.

# Creating a table view
To be able to view the `Categories` table, we're going to need three things:

1. A view model to wrap `Category` instances. We can actually get away without
   having a model, but having a model greatly simplifies some of the operations
   we will implement in the next article.
2. A controller for interacting with the database
3. A view for displaying the data.

We will do all of this in a new file called `categoryview.kt`. Let's start with
the view model, as it is by far the simplest component.

## An ItemViewModel wrapper for Category
For this, we'll extend a utility class called `ItemViewModel` (you can read
about it in detail in the
[TornadoFX guide](https://edvin.gitbooks.io/tornadofx-guide/part1/11.%20Editing%20Models%20and%20Validation.html).
It will simply look like this:

```kotlin
import tornadofx.*

class CategoryModel : ItemViewModel<Category>() {
    val name = bind(Category::name)
    val description = bind(Category::description)
}
```

This is essentially a proxy for the `Category` class, acting as a middle-man
between the presentation layer and the database access layer. Any change we
make to a `CategoryModel` in the GUI will be stored in the model alone, and
will only propagate to the underlying `Category` object when we _commit_ the
change(s).  This is very convenient, as it allows us to buffer changes and then
commit all of them in a single database transaction, instead of having one
transaction per change. Now, let's move on to the controller.

## The database controller
The controller is also fairly simple. Initially, it will only be able to fetch
items from the database. In the next article, we will extend the controller
with add and delete-functionality. Here's the initial version of the
controller:

```kotlin
import javafx.collections.ObservableList
import java.sql.Connection
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.Database
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.transaction
import org.jetbrains.exposed.sql.transactions.TransactionManager

class DBController : Controller() {
    val categories: ObservableList<CategoryModel> by lazy {
        transaction {
            Category.all().map {
                CategoryModel().apply {
                    item = it
                }
            }.observable()
        }
    }

    init {
        Database.connect("jdbc:sqlite:file:data.sqlite", driver = "org.sqlite.JDBC")
        TransactionManager.manager.defaultIsolationLevel = Connection.TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE
    }
}
```

The `categories` property is lazily initialized to a fetch from the database,
in which all `Category` DAOs are wrapped in `CategoryModel`s. There's a bit of
a trade-off here: it's more efficient to fetch the whole table only once and
then maintain the state with any objects that are added or `init` contains
precisely the same database connection setup that we used in the first article.
Let's move on to the actual view.

## The table view
For the table view, we're going to use a `TableViewEditModel` instead of a
plain `TableView`. The reason is that the `TableViewEditModel` has some
additional functionality, most notably the ability to edit rows directly in the
table. Again, you can read up on the details in the
[TornadoFX guide](https://edvin.gitbooks.io/tornadofx-guide/part1/11.%20Editing%20Models%20and%20Validation.html). Our initial attempt looks like this:

```kotlin
class CategoryEditor : View("Categories") {
    val dbController: DBController by inject()
    var categoryTable: TableViewEditModel<CategoryModel> by singleAssign()
    var categories: ObservableList<CategoryModel> by singleAssign()

    override val root = borderpane {
        categories = dbController.categories

        center = tableview<CategoryModel> {
            categoryTable = editModel
            items = categories

            column("Name", CategoryModel::name)
            column("Description", CategoryModel::description)
        }
    }
}
```

There's not too much going on here. The three properties store references to
the controller, the table view, and the list of categories. The view itself is
not very eventful either, we simply fetch the categories using the controller
and initialize the table view. Note that `editModel` and `items` are properties
of the `TableViewEditModel`, where the former is a reference to the table and
the latter the property containing the items of the table (which we set to the
`categories` observable list). Later, when we wish to update the table, we
simply work with the `categories` list. Don't worry that there are some unused
references here, we will put them to use in the next article.

## Creating a runnable app
Now, we just need to make the app runnable. That's as simple as adding the
following:

```kotlin
class Kuizzy : App(CategoryEditor::class)


fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    launch<Kuizzy>(args)
}
```

Running the main method will start the app, and you should then see a view that
looks something like this:

![Read only view]({static}/images/tornado_exposed/read_only_view.jpg)

That's pretty much it for this part. In the next and final part, we'll look
into how to add, delete and edit rows of the `Categories` table. You can find
