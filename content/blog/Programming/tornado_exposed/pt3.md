Welcome to the third and final part in this article series on using TornadoFX
together with Exposed. In the previous two parts, we set up the database with a
single table and created a simple TornadoFX view with which we could view its
contents. Now, we will focus on adding and deleting rows to the `Categories`
table, as well as adding new ones. This part is a bit longer than the two
previous ones, but it also contains a whole lot more content.

# Making the app interactive
So far, all we can do with our app is view the contents of the database. That's
neat and all, but it would be even nicer if we could interact with the database
and edit its contents. What this article will address is how to:

1. Delete rows.
2. Add rows.
3. Edit rows.

Deleting rows is the simplest thing to accomplish, so let's start with that.

## Deleting rows
Deleting a row is pretty easy. First, we'll add the desired functionality to
the controller.

```kotlin
fun deleteCategory(model: CategoryModel) {
    transaction {
        model.item.delete()
    }
    categories.remove(model)
}
```

Note that `model.item` returns the backing `Category` object, on which we
simply call `delete()` to remove it from the database. Then, we also have to
update our local list by removing the model from it. Note that I assume `model`
to be in the `categories` list for the sake of simplicity, but this is a pretty
bold assumption that you probably should not make in a real application. Now,
let's put this new functionality to work: we need to add a button to the view
that calls the delete function on the currently selected row. We will slightly
alter the layout to make this happen. We change this:

```kotlin
override val root = borderpane {
    categories = dbController.categories

    center = tableview<CategoryModel> {
        categoryTable = editModel
        items = categories

        column("Name", CategoryModel::name)
        column("Description", CategoryModel::description)
    }
}
```

to this:

```kotlin
override val root = borderpane {
    categories = dbController.categories

    center = vbox {
        buttonbar {
            button("DELETE SELECTED") {
                action {
                    val model = categoryTable.tableView.selectedItem
                    when (model) {
                        null -> return@action
                        else -> dbController.deleteCategory(model)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        tableview<CategoryModel> {
            categoryTable = editModel
            items = categories

            column("Name", CategoryModel::name)
            column("Description", CategoryModel::description)
        }
    }
}
```

We use a `buttonbar` as we will be adding more buttons later on. The code should
be fairly easy to read: the button's action will do nothing if the currently
selected model is `null` (i.e. nothing is selected), and call the
`deleteCategory` method otherwise. You should now have a view looking something
like this:

![Table view with a delete button]({static}/images/tornado_exposed/view_with_delete.jpg)

If you first click a row and then the delete button, the row should disappear.
Now that we can delete rows, let's turn our attention to adding new rows.

## Adding new rows
For this, we're going to add a small form to the right of the table which will
allow us to enter new rows. As before, we'll start with the controller, adding
the following method to it:

```kotlin
fun addCategory(name: String, description: String) {
    transaction {
        val category = Category.new {
            this.name = name
            this.description = description
        }
        categories.add(
            CategoryModel().apply {
                item = category
            })
    }
}
```

Here, we first create a new `Category`, and then add it to the `categories`
list (wrapped in a `CategoryModel`). Now, we need to add the form to the view
so we can submit the values for `name` and `description`. First, we need to add
two new properties to the `CategoryEditor` view:

```kotlin
var nameField: TextField by singleAssign()
var descriptionField: TextField by singleAssign()
```

We need these to be able to access what we put in the form fields.  We also
need to import `TextField`

```kotlin
import javafx.scene.control.TextField
```

To add the actual form, we put the following _after_ the `center` element:

```kotlin
right = form {
    fieldset {
        field("Name") {
            textfield {
                nameField = this
            }
        }
    }
    fieldset {
        field("Description") {
            textfield {
                descriptionField = this
            }
        }
    }
    button("ADD CATEGORY") {
        action {
            dbController.addCategory(nameField.text, descriptionField.text)
            nameField.text = ""
            descriptionField.text = ""
        }
    }
}
```

This will result in a view looking something like this:

![View with add category form]({static}/images/tornado_exposed/view_with_add_form.jpg)

Writing some stuff in the fields and clicking `ADD CATEGORY` should immediately
create a new row in the table. Not the most beautiful thing in the world, I'll
admit, but it serves its purpose for this guide. Now we only have one more
feature to add, namely editing rows.

## Editing rows
Now we will finally see why we used a `TableViewEditModel` instead of a plain
`TableView`: the former allows us to edit rows directly in the table. To allow
for inline editing, we need to add some stuff to the view itself. Our table
view currently looks like this:

```kotlin
tableview<CategoryModel> {
    categoryTable = editModel
    items = categories

    column("Name", CategoryModel::name)
    column("Description", CategoryModel::description)
}
```

To enable editing, we simply add a call to `enableCellEditing()`, and call
`makeEditable()` on the columns. We'll also add `enableDirtyTracking()` to
allow us to see which cells have been edited, but not saved.

```kotlin
tableview<CategoryModel> {
    categoryTable = editModel
    items = categories

    enableCellEditing()
    enableDirtyTracking()

    column("Name", CategoryModel::name).makeEditable()
    column("Description", CategoryModel::description).makeEditable()
}
```

Now, we can edit cells by clicking them:

![Editing a cell]({static}/images/tornado_exposed/editing_cell.jpg)

And after pressing enter, we can see that the cell has been edited by the blue
triangle. The cell is _dirty_:

![Dirty cell]({static}/images/tornado_exposed/edited_cell.jpg)

However, the change won't "stick". If we restart the application, the text will
be back to what it was before we edited the cell. The reason is that the change
was never committed to the database, it was just stored in the model. Thus,
what we need now is to commit any dirty rows to the database. As always, we
start with adding the functionality we need from the controller.

```kotlin
fun commitDirty(modelDirtyMappings: Sequence<Map.Entry<CategoryModel, TableColumnDirtyState<CategoryModel>>>) {
    transaction {
        modelDirtyMappings.filter { it.value.isDirty }.forEach {
            it.key.commit()     // commit value to database
            it.value.commit()   // clear dirty state
        }
    }
}
```

This function iterates over a sequence of map entries that map a model (key) to
a dirty state (value). We'll soon see that we can get such a map from the table
view. Note that committing the key _must_ be done in a transaction, as it will
write to the database. The type is a bit of a mouthful, though, so let's define
a type alias for it.

```kotlin
typealias ModelToDirtyState = Map.Entry<CategoryModel, TableColumnDirtyState<CategoryModel>>
```

Note that the `typealias` must be a top level declaration (i.e. you can't put
it in a class or function). And rewrite the header of `commitDirty` like this:


```kotlin
fun commitDirty(modelDirtyMappings: Sequence<ModelToDirtyState>)
```

Slightly more readable, right? Now, let's put it to use. We'll add a new button
in the button bar to execute the commit.

```kotlin
button("COMMIT") {
    action {
        dbController.commitDirty(categoryTable.items.asSequence())
    }
}
```

Clicking this button when there are dirty cells will allow us to commit these
to the database. As a finishing touch, we'll add a button to reset (rollback)
dirty cells to their previous state.

```kotlin
button("ROLLBACK") {
    action {
        categoryTable.rollback()
    }
}
```

Note that this does not require a transaction, as all that happens is that the
model state is reset (the DAO is unaffected). This will leave us with a final
GUI looking like this:

# Closing words
That was all for this series of articles on TornadoFX and exposed. This is by
no means a fully-fledged database UI, but it is a pretty good start.  There are
tons of things here that need to be improved, though. Below are a few examples
off the top of my head.

* There is just about no error handling, everything is just assumed to work
  out.  For example, if a user enters a duplicate category, an unhandled
  exception is raised.
* Much of the functionality is very specific to the `Category` type, and needs
  to be generalized. As a lot of this is done with generics, such
  generalization is actually not trivial (as generic types are invariant by
  default).
* There is a lot of room for user error. For example, deleting a row is done
  without prompting the user with something like "Are you sure you wanna do
  this?". The commit/rollback functionality of editing is much more user
  friendly and a step in the right direction.
* The views are completely unstyled and look rather dull.

And with that, I wish you good fortune in working with this! Of course, you are
free to use all of these examples as you see fit.
