_97 Things Every Programmer Should Know_ is a collection of short essays by
experienced programmers. And by short, I mean _short_: 1-3 fairly tiny pages a
piece. If you're on a journey to become a software engineer then this book will
give you a crash course in terminology you should be familiar with. Even as a
practicing software engineer there is wisdom to be found in this book, but a
novice will undoubtedly get more out of reading it.

# The book in a nutshell
As I mentioned in the introduction, _97 Things Every Programmer Should Know_ is
a collection of very short essays by practicing professionals. The essays treat
a wide variety of themes that are relevant to a practicing software engineer,
ranging from hard technical skills such as the _Don't Repeat Yourself_ principle
and _Single Responsibility Principle_, to softer skills such as interacting with
managers and fostering good relationships with your colleagues. Most of the
essays are focused on the technical side of things, however, and there is good
variety in the technical topics. While a lot of the essays are about how to
write good code, there is also a healthy amount of recommendations for tooling
to use, such as static code analysers, automated test suites, version control
systems and more.

There really isn't much more to say regarding what the book is about. It's like
a collection of very well-written blog posts on programming-related topics. So
if you're reading this blog, chances are good you're going to enjoy this book.

# What I liked
In some ways, _97 Things_ has a lot in common with [Apprenticeship
Patterns]({filename}apprenticeship_patterns.md) that I reviewed last week.
They're both about how you improve as a software engineer. The difference is
that _97 Things_ is a lot more to the point and more concrete. For the most
part, it presents tips and tricks that you can apply immediately and see
benefits from just as fast. For the budding software engineer, it's an excellent
pool of topics to diversify your skill set. That's with an emphasis on _topics_,
though. This book presents a brief introduction to a wide variety of topics, but
it dives deeply into none of them. I think this is a great strength of the book,
as it means you will never get stuck on some "boring" topic that doesn't
interest you.

While you can absolutely draw connections between the essays, they are written
as standalone pieces of work. This makes _97 Things_ a perfect book to read on
the go, when you might just have a few minutes or so to read.

Out of all 97 things, I recall only a handful that I didn't find genuinely
helpful or insightful. Some essays even contradict each other, which actually
gives a nice perspective on the fact that a _lot_ of best practices are, to a
large degree, opinions. A notable example I recall is about automatic code
formatting, where one essay discourages its use and a few others encourage it.
I think this is a great benefit of having so many different authors. You don't
just get one person's opinion.

# What I didn't like
As with many other books on how to be a good software engineer, there is a slight
tint of workaholism over some of the essays. I especially found an essay by
Robert C. Martin on what it means to be a professional programmer to send this
message. It's the same theme I found a little bit disturbing with
[Apprenticeship Patterns]({filename}apprenticeship_patterns.md). I can't say I
disagree with the message; I truly believe in the craftsmanship approach to
software engineering, the path of lifelong learning. But at the same time I
don't think it is for everyone, and I think it should be possible to treat
programming as "just a job".

A minor inconvenience is that the essays are ordered alphabetically, where I
would have preferred them to be ordered by theme. Finding a particular essay of
which you recall the theme but not the title is needlessly difficult. I just now
suffered through it trying to find the aforementioned essay by Robert C. Martin.

But as a package, I find little to dislike about the book. Even the workaholism
part is effectively counteracted by an entire essay dedicated to sending the
message "work smarter not harder".

# Conclusions
This is another book that I wish I'd read years ago. I strongly recommend it as
a read for _any_ software engineer at the beginning of their career or student
(self-taught or at a seat of learning) who is preparing for their career. Being
such a light and quick read, I find no good reason not to spend the few hours it
takes to read through the book and be exposed to a whole lot of different ideas.
