In order to actually get around to writing some content, I've decided to start
a little series: Tip of the Week! Every week, I'll spend 30 minutes or so
writing a very small article about some tip related to programming, Linux or
technology in general. And no, this one does not count, so I still have to
write this week's TotW!
