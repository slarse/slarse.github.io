Another Tip of the Week, in the same week as the previous one (because I've
been slacking off). This one is very simple, and rather non-technical. I simply
want to direct attention toward
[humblebundle.com](https://www.humblebundle.com/), and their quite frequent book
bundles. Many of these book bundles include or are entirely centered around
programming topics. I've gotten tons of great books from there over the years,
and it can really pay off to keep an eye on the new bundles. Typically, the top
tier of a book bundle is around 15-20 EUR, while most books in it cost more
alone. There have been general programming bundles, hacking/security bundles,
Python bundles (a lot of them), Linux bundles, and much more. A few of the best
books I've gotten from Humble include:

* [The Linux Programming Interface](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook/dp/1593272200)
    - Got it in a 20 EUR bundle, while this book alone costs somewhere around 70.
* [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming-dp-1491946008/dp/1491946008/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)
    - I actually already owned this book at the time of acquiring it from a
      bundle, but it's by far the best book on Python I've ever read.
* [Flask Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/Flask-Web-Development-Developing-Applications-dp-1491991739/dp/1491991739/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1560410372)
* [CSS: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.com/CSS-Definitive-Guide-Visual-Presentation-dp-1449393195/dp/1449393195/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1560410482)

And many, many more! Really, all I want to get said with this TOTW is that you
should really keep an eye on Humble Bundle, as their book bundles contain
tremendous value, and you can choose to put some (or all) of the money you pay
toward charity. And that's all there is to it!
