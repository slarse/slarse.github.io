This is the first part of a series of small articles detailing some of the
functionality of the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) testing
framework that I find most essential. The series assumes you know how to run
tests with `pytest` already.

In this first part, we'll take a look at the `-v` and `--tb` options to control
the verbosity of the output.

## The test suite
For the purposes of this article, I've implemented a very simple multiplication
function called `mul`, along with a few tests. Here's the entire thing, in a
file called `mul.py`:

```python
# mul.py
def mul(lhs, rhs):
    return lhs * lhs

def test_multiply_equal_numbers():
    assert mul(5, 5) == 25

def test_multiply_by_zero():
    assert mul(1, 0) == 0

def test_multiply_different_numbers():
    assert mul(5, 3) == 15
```

Obviously, the implementation of `mul` is broken, and running `pytest` gives
the following output.

```bash
$ pytest mul.py 
========================== test session starts ===========================

    def test_multiply_different_numbers():

E        +  where 25 = mul(5, 3)

mul.py:11: AssertionError

FAILED mul.py::test_multiply_different_numbers - assert 25 == 15
====================== 2 failed, 1 passed in 0.08s =======================
```

Let's learn how to control how much of this we see.

## Using the `--tb` option to control traceback verbosity
Most of what you're seeing in the output of the previous section is the
_traceback_ information. While the traceback shown above is manageable as is,
consider that it stems from a single-line function and single-line tests. With
that in mind, it's actually pretty freaking verbose. We can show less of it by
using the `--tb` option. We can even shut it off completely.

```bash
$ pytest mul.py --tb=no
========================== test session starts ===========================
platform linux -- Python 3.8.3, pytest-5.4.3, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1
rootdir: /home/slarse/Documents/github/python/mul
collected 3 items                                                        

mul.py .FF                                                         [100%]

======================== short test summary info =========================
FAILED mul.py::test_multiply_by_zero - assert 1 == 0
FAILED mul.py::test_multiply_different_numbers - assert 25 == 15
====================== 2 failed, 1 passed in 0.02s =======================
```

This is useful when you're just trying to figure out what tests are failing, and
when test output is just entirely overwhelming. I find myself using it quite
frequently. Another useful traceback value is `line`.

```bash
$ pytest mul.py --tb=line
========================== test session starts ===========================
platform linux -- Python 3.8.3, pytest-5.4.3, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1
rootdir: /home/slarse/Documents/github/python/mul
collected 3 items                                                        

mul.py .FF                                                         [100%]

================================ FAILURES ================================
/home/slarse/Documents/github/python/mul/mul.py:8: assert 1 == 0
/home/slarse/Documents/github/python/mul/mul.py:11: assert 25 == 15
======================== short test summary info =========================
FAILED mul.py::test_multiply_by_zero - assert 1 == 0
FAILED mul.py::test_multiply_different_numbers - assert 25 == 15
====================== 2 failed, 1 passed in 0.03s =======================
```
This lets us see the exact lines where the test failures occurred. In this case,
it shows the lines of the assertions, but it could also for example show the
line where an exception was raised.

Another one that I find really useful is `--tb=short`. It shows the full
traceback, but with much less context around each function call. It won't
make much of a difference for this short a traceback, but it makes a world of
difference for deeply nested function calls.

There are more ways to manipulate the traceback, but these are the two I use the
most, aside from the default. To see the other options, refer to `pytest -h` and
look for the `--tb` option.

## Using `-v` to show more verbose test output
The `-v` option controls the verbosity of test output while the tests are
running, and also the verbosity of single items in the traceback. It's really
useful when tests take a long time to run, and you want to know approximately
where you're at.

```bash
$ pytest mul.py --tb=no -v
========================== test session starts ===========================
platform linux -- Python 3.8.3, pytest-5.4.3, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1 -- /usr/bin/python
cachedir: .pytest_cache
rootdir: /home/slarse/Documents/github/python/mul
collected 3 items                                                        

mul.py::test_multiply_equal_numbers PASSED                         [ 33%]
mul.py::test_multiply_by_zero FAILED                               [ 66%]
mul.py::test_multiply_different_numbers FAILED                     [100%]

======================== short test summary info =========================
FAILED mul.py::test_multiply_by_zero - assert 1 == 0
FAILED mul.py::test_multiply_different_numbers - assert 25 == 15
====================== 2 failed, 1 passed in 0.03s =======================
```
Note how each test is now shown on a line of its own, as opposed to just `.` and
`F` in the previous runs. The lines show up as the tests are running, and I find
it useful to track long-running tests.

But what about that "single-item" verbosity that I mentioned? When there are
single items in the traceback that are very large, such as a list of say 1000
elements, then pytest will truncate them by default. To demnstrate, consider
this single (pointless) test:

```python
# test_truncation.py
import pytest

def test_truncation_demonstration():
    assert [0, 1, 2, 3] == list(range(1000))
```

Running this test will yield a traceback that looks something like this.

```bash
$ pytest test_truncation.py
[... OMITTED ...]
______________________ test_truncation_demonstration _____________________

    def test_truncation_demonstration():
    >       assert [0, 1, 2, 3] == list(range(1000))
    E       assert [0, 1, 2, 3] == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
    E         Right contains 996 more items, first extra item: 4
    E         Use -v to get the full diff

    truncation.py:4: AssertionError
```

Note how the long list has been truncated such that only the first few items are
shown. Note also how pytest is suggesting the use of `-v`. If we supply `-v`, it
actually still doesn't show the whole list.

```bash
$ pytest test_truncation.py -v
[... OMITTED ...]
______________________ test_truncation_demonstration _____________________

    def test_truncation_demonstration():
    >       assert [0, 1, 2, 3] == list(range(1000))
    E       AssertionError: assert [0, 1, 2, 3] == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
    E         Right contains 996 more items, first extra item: 4
    E         Full diff:
    E           [
    E            0,
    E            1,
    E            2,
    E            3,...
    E         
    E         ...Full output truncated (998 lines hidden), use '-vv' to show

    truncation.py:4: AssertionError
```

In fact, pytest isn't even showing more output here, it just shows the same
things more verbosely. If we stack `-v` twice, i.e. `-vv` or `-v -v`, then we
get the full output. I find `-v` on its own to be rather useless, and typically
always supply `-vv` if I want verbose output. For obvious reasons, I will not
show what that output looks like.

## Summary
In this article, we had a look at the `--tb` and `-v` options to control output
verbosity in pytest. `--tb` controls the overall size of the traceback, and can
be supplied with values like `no` for no output at all, `line` for just a single
line of traceback, or `short` for complete traceback with shortened context.
`-v` controls the verbosity of running tests and single items in the traceback,
such as very long lists which are truncated by default. Typically, `-vv` is
required to get fully verbose output.

And that's about it, I hope you learned something!
