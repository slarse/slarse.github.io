Title: About

### About me
Hello! My name is Simon, and I'm a software engineer with an MSc in Computer
Science and Engineering from [Royal Technical Institute in Stockholm
(KTH)](https://kth.se). I'm enthusiastic about open-source development, and
spend much of my free time working on
[RepoBee](https://github.com/repobee/repobee). I also contribute to other
projects, such as [Spork](https://github.com/KTH/spork) and
[Spoon](https://github.com/inria/spoon).

When I'm not coding, I enjoy tinkering with my desktop computer, playing
computer games, reading books or exercising. As is evident by this website,
I also occasionally write an article or two.

### About this website
This site serves primarily as my private blog. I sometimes write lengthy
articles and even series of articles on topics related to programming,
mostly within the Python or Kotlin programming languages. I find that it's
a good way to retain newly aquired knowledge. I also try to keep the site up to
date with my current [Projects]({filename}/pages/projects.md).

### What is this "slarse"?
"slarse" was the (presumably) automatically generated username that I was
provided with when I started studying at KTH. It just kind of stuck. When I
started working as a TA, one of my colleagues even called me slarse for over a
year because that's what came to mind first for him. It's more or less my online
identity nowadays.
