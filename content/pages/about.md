### About me
Hello! My name is Simon. I'm a fourth-year computer science student at the
[Royal Technical Institute in Stockholm (KTH)](https://kth.se). Currently, I'm
working my way toward a Civil Engineering degree in computer science, focusing
on programming languages and software development. In addition to studying, I
also work as a teaching assistant on several courses at KTH, do some freelance
web development on the side and work on my own projects whenever there is time
left over.
