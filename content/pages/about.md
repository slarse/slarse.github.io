Title: About

### About me
Hello! My name is Simon. I'm a fourth-year computer science student at the
[Royal Technical Institute in Stockholm (KTH)](https://kth.se). Currently, I'm
working my way toward a Civil Engineering degree in computer science, focusing
on programming languages and software development. In addition to studying, I
also work as a teaching assistant on several courses at KTH, do some freelance
web development on the side and work on my own projects whenever there is time
left over.

### What is this "slarse"?
"slarse" was the (presumably) automatically generated username that I was
provided with when I started studying at KTH. It just kind of stuck. When I
started working as a TA, one of my colleagues even called me slarse for over a
year because that's what came to mind first for him. It's more or less my online
identity/alias nowadays.
