Title: About

## About me
Hello! My name is Simon, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for
digging deep into technical topics and teaching them to others. As far
as credentials go, I have an MSc in Computer Science and Engineering from [KTH
Royal Institute of Technology](https://kth.se). I taught computer science
topics there for over four years and I probably learned more myself than any
of my students ever did. Continuing on that road out in industry, I've both
taught in trainee programs and held talks at meetups.

I enjoy open-source development and spend much of my free time working on
projects in that sphere. See the [Projects page]({filename}projects.md)
for more on that, or just head [directly to my
GitHub](https://github.com/slarse). When I'm not coding, I enjoy tinkering with
my desktop computer, playing computer games, reading books or exercising. As is
evident by this website, I also occasionally write an article or two.

## About this website
This site serves primarily as my private blog. I sometimes write lengthy
articles and even series of articles on topics related to programming,
mostly within the Python programming language. I find that it's a good way to
retain newly aquired knowledge. I also have a [Wiki]({filename}wiki/index.md)
where I gather knowlegde that I don't have the time to write a full-fledged
article about.

## What is this "slarse"?
"slarse" was the (presumably) automatically generated username that I was
provided with when I started studying at KTH. It just kind of stuck. When I
started working as a TA, one of my colleagues even called me slarse for over a
year because that's what came to mind first for him. It's more or less my online
identity nowadays.
