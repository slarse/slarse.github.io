Title: Projects

I always have a few side projects going. You can find an exhaustive list on my
GitHub page, but here are a few highlights.

## RepoBee
RepoBee is a tool for managing Git repositories on GitHub for education. It can
do things like generate repositories for students, clone student repositories
in batches, run tasks on the cloned repositories as defined by plugins, and
more. I'm really quite proud of it, and have some exciting things coming up for
it this summer (that I can't yet talk about).

## Spoon
Spoon is a popular metaprogramming library for Java. It allows you to parse
source code into a rich AST, analyze and/or transform the AST and print it
back to source code. I'm one of a handful of maintainers on the project.

## Spork
Spork is an AST based structured merge tool for Java. This means that instead
of merging Java files by their raw text, it resolves the abstract syntax trees
and merges based on them instead. It is built on top of Spoon.

## Rusthon
Rusthon is a Python-like programming language implemented in Rust. It is a work
in progress that serves as my learning project to learn the ins and outs of the
Rust programming language.
