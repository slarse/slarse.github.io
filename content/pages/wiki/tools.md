Title: Tools for Software Engineering
Slug: wiki/tools

I love tinkering with my environment. So much so that I've been known to spend
more time tinkering than I actually end up using the particular tool or utility
I just put in place. Regardless, I'm a huge fan of neat tools that improve my
software engineering workflows or just general usage of my machines. I'm
continuously expanding this list as I find new tools and recall ones that I
already use.

## Command Line Tools
Command line tools are my bread and butter. Here's a selection of my favorite
tools.

### [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) - `cd` that learns!
* Instead of `cd ~/path/to/my/best-project`, just type `j best-project`!
* Finds the directory I want the vast majority of the time

### [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - The future (and present) of Vim
* You know what it is, it's Vim. But better.
* I use it for everything. That's the largest appeal for me. One editor for all
    my editing needs.

### [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - The best fuzzy finder around
* A _fuzzy finder_ allowing you to search through text with inexact (fuzzy) search terms
* Great integration with `neovim`

### [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - `grep`, but fast!
* An incredibly fast implementation of the classic `grep` utility
* Great integration with `neovim`

## GUI utilities
I don't use a whole lot of GUI utilities, but I've found a few really neat ones
over the years.

### [i3](https://i3wm.org/) - Improved tiling window manager
* A tiling window manager - once you go tiling, you never go back!
    - Seriously, try it. You'll wonder why you ever had floating windows.
* Relatively easy to get started with
* Highly customizable

### [warpd](https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd) - Navigate GUIs with your keyboard
* Navigate your GUIs using your keyboard
* Fantastic for use with a laptop

### [zeal](https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal) - Offline docs
* Keep your docs locally on your machine instead of having to navigate to a
    docs website
* Comes out-of-the-box with docs for most major programming languages, like
    Python, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, GoLang, Rust, C etc.
* If that's not enough, [you can create your own docsets](https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal#create-your-own-docsets)
* For MacOs users, [dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) does exactly the same
    thing
