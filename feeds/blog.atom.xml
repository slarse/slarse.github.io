(ITiCSE) conference in lovely Aberdeen, Scotland. I was there to present a small
experience paper on developing and using &lt;a href="https://repobee.org"&gt;RepoBee&lt;/a&gt;, an open
source tool for generating and managing large amounts of Git repositories for
students in higher education. The paper is available over in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3304221.3319784"&gt;ACM Digital
Library&lt;/a&gt;, and it's my very first
publication outside of school, so I'm quite proud of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference itself was also terrific. The atmosphere was very friendly, there
were many interesting talks and social activities, and I have a hard time
imagining how a conference could be more inviting to a first-time
conference-goer like me. If you have a chance to attend it, I highly recommend
doing so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Migrating my blog</title><link href="https://slar.se/migrating-my-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-06T18:32:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-04-10T23:20:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Simon Larsén</name></author><id>tag:slar.se,2019-04-06:/migrating-my-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
