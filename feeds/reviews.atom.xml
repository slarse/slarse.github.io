&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The book in a nutshell&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the introduction, &lt;em&gt;97 Things Every Programmer Should Know&lt;/em&gt; is
a collection of very short essays by practicing professionals. The essays treat
a wide variety of themes that are relevant to a practicing software engineer,
ranging from hard technical skills such as the &lt;em&gt;Don't Repeat Yourself&lt;/em&gt; principle
and &lt;em&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt;, to softer skills such as interacting with
managers and fostering good relationships with your colleagues. Most of the
essays are focused on the technical side of things, however, and there is good
variety in the technical topics. While a lot of the essays are about how to
write good code, there is also a healthy amount of recommendations for tooling
to use, such as static code analysers, automated test suites, version control
systems and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really isn't much more to say regarding what the book is about. It's like
a collection of very well-written blog posts on programming-related topics. So
if you're reading this blog, chances are good you're going to enjoy this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What I liked&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, &lt;em&gt;97 Things&lt;/em&gt; has a lot in common with &lt;a href="https://slar.se/book-review-apprenticeship-patterns.html"&gt;Apprenticeship
Patterns&lt;/a&gt; that I reviewed last week.
They're both about how you improve as a software engineer. The difference is
that &lt;em&gt;97 Things&lt;/em&gt; is a lot more to the point and more concrete. For the most
part, it presents tips and tricks that you can apply immediately and see
benefits from just as fast. For the budding software engineer, it's an excellent
pool of topics to diversify your skill set. That's with an emphasis on &lt;em&gt;topics&lt;/em&gt;,
though. This book presents a brief introduction to a wide variety of topics, but
it dives deeply into none of them. I think this is a great strength of the book,
as it means you will never get stuck on some "boring" topic that doesn't
interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can absolutely draw connections between the essays, they are written
as standalone pieces of work. This makes &lt;em&gt;97 Things&lt;/em&gt; a perfect book to read on
the go, when you might just have a few minutes or so to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all 97 things, I recall only a handful that I didn't find genuinely
helpful or insightful. Some essays even contradict each other, which actually
gives a nice perspective on the fact that a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of best practices are, to a
large degree, opinions. A notable example I recall is about automatic code
formatting, where one essay discourages its use and a few others encourage it.
I think this is a great benefit of having so many different authors. You don't
just get one person's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What I didn't like&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many other books on how to be a good software engineer, there is a slight
tint of workaholism over some of the essays. I especially found an essay by
Robert C. Martin on what it means to be a professional programmer to send this
message. It's the same theme I found a little bit disturbing with
&lt;a href="https://slar.se/book-review-apprenticeship-patterns.html"&gt;Apprenticeship Patterns&lt;/a&gt;. I can't say I
disagree with the message; I truly believe in the craftsmanship approach to
software engineering, the path of lifelong learning. But at the same time I
don't think it is for everyone, and I think it should be possible to treat
programming as "just a job".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minor inconvenience is that the essays are ordered alphabetically, where I
would have preferred them to be ordered by theme. Finding a particular essay of
which you recall the theme but not the title is needlessly difficult. I just now
suffered through it trying to find the aforementioned essay by Robert C. Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as a package, I find little to dislike about the book. Even the workaholism
part is effectively counteracted by an entire essay dedicated to sending the
message "work smarter not harder".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another book that I wish I'd read years ago. I strongly recommend it as
a read for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; software engineer at the beginning of their career or student
(self-taught or at a seat of learning) who is preparing for their career. Being
such a light and quick read, I find no good reason not to spend the few hours it
takes to read through the book and be exposed to a whole lot of different ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category><category term="book review"></category><category term="software engineering"></category></entry><entry><title>Book Review: Apprenticeship Patterns</title><link href="https://slar.se/book-review-apprenticeship-patterns.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-02T13:00:48+02:00</published><updated>2022-07-02T13:27:48+02:00</updated><author><name>Simon Larsén</name></author><id>tag:slar.se,2022-07-02:/book-review-apprenticeship-patterns.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman&lt;/em&gt; is

fundamentally a book about lifelong learning. It is about treating software
engineering as a craft you may never master; in fact it may never have been
mastered before. Perhaps it simply cannot be mastered in the traditional sense
of the word. But that doesn't mean that we should not aspire to master it, that
we should not embark on &lt;em&gt;The Long Road&lt;/em&gt;. So how can a book help with that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ISBN&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9780596518387&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The book in a nutshell&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core tenet of the book is that software engineering is a &lt;em&gt;craft&lt;/em&gt;. A craft in
the same sense that blacksmithing is, or carpentry, or the construction of
musical instruments. The authors provide a concise reasoning for why this is so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is a craft precisely because we don't understand it well
enough to make it a codified discipline like science or engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can agree or disagree with this statement, but it is hard to argue against
the notion that software engineering is something that requires a high degree of
&lt;em&gt;skill&lt;/em&gt;. That's not skill as in technical proficiency, although that is part of
it. It's skill as in everything that encompasses a successful software engineer,
of which technical proficiency is important but far from being the skill in it's
own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, &lt;em&gt;Apprenticeship Patterns&lt;/em&gt; is comprised of a series of
&lt;em&gt;patterns&lt;/em&gt;. These are meant to help you hone your skill as a software craftsman.
Each pattern is composed of four parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context: A generalized context to put the pattern in perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem: A concrete problem statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: One or more suggestions for solving or alleviating the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action: A concrete exercise to practice the solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patterns are really &lt;em&gt;contextual habits&lt;/em&gt;; given a situation X it is
appropriate to do Y. A (perhaps &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;) core pattern is &lt;em&gt;The Long Road&lt;/em&gt;, which
boils down to the fact that mastering a craft is a lifelong process. It
challenges the notion that the quickest way to success as measured in notoriety
or material wealth is what one should aspire for. The solution is a lengthy
affair, but it importantly suggests that climbing the corporate ladder through
quick promotions or similar easily takes you away from the actual crafting of
software, thus diverting you from The Long Road. You should be prepared to work
as a developer for many years to come. Many of the other patterns of the book
complement The Long Road, such as &lt;em&gt;Stay In The Trenches&lt;/em&gt; which specifically
deals with the problem of success being rewarded with promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pattern that struck home with me is &lt;em&gt;Record What You Learn&lt;/em&gt;. Quite
unsurprisingly, it simply suggests that one should keep a record of the things
you have learned and plan to learn in the future. This book review is in fact a
direct application of that pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many, many more patterns in the book. Some of my favorite ones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be The Worst&lt;/em&gt;: Place yourself in situations where you are surrounded by
  craftsmen that are more skilled than you in some area, and that you can learn
  from. Avoid becoming complacent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share What You Learn&lt;/em&gt;: Put your learning experiences out in the open, for
  anyone to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred Spirits&lt;/em&gt;: Surround yourself with others passionate to learn the
  things you wish to dive into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use The Source&lt;/em&gt;: Read open source code. A lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read Constantly&lt;/em&gt;: Read books. A lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to list all the patterns that resonated with me, and I can't even
do these few ones justice with just this brief explanation of them. You really
need to read the book with each context, problem, solution and action for the
respective patterns to get the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What I liked&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a very easy read. I like to have at least one &lt;em&gt;soft&lt;/em&gt; book to read
when my mind wanders too much for me to take in a technical book, and
&lt;em&gt;Apprenticeship Patterns&lt;/em&gt; perfectly fits that bill. It took me a couple of weeks
with a few pages a night to get through it. It's easy to pick it up, read about
a pattern or two, and then put it down. It's well organized and easy to refer
back to after completion. The patterns are presented with just enough context to
make them understandable, yet the authors do not dwell on things for too long.
It is a concise book that is still easy to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found that it is a highly inspirational book, and approaching software
engineering as a craft really speaks to me. Many of the patterns of this book
are quite obvious to me and I practice several of them already, yet there are
many patterns I think I should practice that I don't. Record What You Learn is
the perfect example. I've been thinking for years that I should do so, but never
really got around to doing it other than a sporadic blog post once or twice a
year. After reading the book, I have newfound motivation to apply many of
the patterns, as this book review is tangible evidence of. In the future, I
intend to always finish up a book with a book review. Hopefully I will improve
in writing them with time, as I am not all that happy with how this review
turned out. But Share What You Learn tells me I should post this anyway, and I
really do agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think this is a terrific book to read as a budding software engineer. It
is called &lt;em&gt;Apprenticeship Patterns&lt;/em&gt;, after all. I wish I would have read it
years ago, and I wish I was already practicing many of the patterns. But better
late than never, and as I will discuss in the next section there is a reason for
me to be somewhat thankful for not reading it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What I didn't like&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think this is a good handbook for mastering a craft, I also think the
approach is potentially unhealthy if applied without moderation. I have
personally struggled a lot with finding a balance between improving my skills as
a software and just living a life separate from software engineering. Or
computers and technology in general. I found the book truly inspirational, so
much so that it prompted be to spend two hours of my Saturday morning writing
this book review. To be completely honest, I am still tweaking the
aforementioned balance. I would not say that I am struggling anymore, but I
cannot deny that it is still a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book struck home with me, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. But that is a
recommendation with a caveat, as I don't think this is a book for everyone.
It's really all in the title, this book is for the aspiring software
&lt;em&gt;craftsman&lt;/em&gt;. I don't think you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to approach software engineering as a
craft that you devote yourself to, and the authors actually allude to this as
well. It's one approach, and it's a great boon to the field that some take it.
But for others, working with software can be "just a job", and not their
passion. That is fine, a job can be just a means to provide for yourself. And
if that's you, then I say skip this book. But if you do have a passion for
building great software, I think this is a book you don't want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Reviews"></category><category term="book review"></category><category term="software engineering"></category></entry></feed>
